# Logins are comprised of an email address (unique key) and a key. This key is the same "master key" for
# access to all the accounts/passwords for the user.

# Scenarios to test:
# Valid email and password, invalid email, invalid password, missing email, missing password,
# invalid email and password(? this would effectively be the same as invalid email, since that's the unique
# key for users),
