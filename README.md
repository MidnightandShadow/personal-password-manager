# Personal Password Manager

This project is still currently in-progress, so temporarily, here's a quick summary of my motivations:
- I currently use my browser to store some of my passwords and I'd like to migrate those to a proper password manager
- Some password managers have had database breaches recently, so I'd like to stay away from those
- Since my internship ended a few months ago, I haven't programmed much, so this would be a nice small project to ease
back into Fall semester

Best case: I create my own free, secure, easy-to-use password manager that can still autofill login fields in my
browser. I can migrate my passwords over and use it myself. Others could potentially use it or build on it.

Worst case: My password manager isn't convenient enough for me to migrate to it, but at least I've learned a bit about
what it takes to create one.
