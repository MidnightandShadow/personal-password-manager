Flow:
Start screen has an empty text input labelled "email" and a button labelled "Log in/Sign up"
- If email is already registered, the screen then replaces the "email" input with a "password" input.
- If email is not associated with a User, screen changes to option for creating an account with
the previously filled in email field and a new password field, plus instructions about making a good "master password".

Upon logging in or successfully registering, the main accounts screen is display.
- Lists rows of account names, their associated emails, obscured passwords (••••••••••), and a toggle to show/hide the
 password.
- Has a header menubar with options to add an account, remove selected accounts, import accounts, export accounts
 (encrypted and plaintext), a searchbar/filter for accounts (can enter account names or emails), and regenerate
 password (for the selected account - pops open dialogue, so you can copy it to your clipboard and not forget to change
 the actual account password). Also has an option to sign out.

 Closing the main GUI window/session automatically logs you out.

Where I left off:
Refactor the Login field 'email' to just be a standard 'username': no change in what the field is, just the name
and some of the test examples.

Refactor the account table login to be username (only a change in name, not anything else)

Designing how to handle inputting object information into the db without using an ORM:
Method in the respective class? Since all used methods so far are static, no python objects and only database and Utils?

Fixing GUI resizing during fullscreen mode, adding small popup (not a dialogue) for "copied to clipboard" when
a username or password is clicked

Editing login to have flow for sign up (if the given username is not in the database, prompt user with a dialogue
for "username not recognized: would you like to sign up?"
